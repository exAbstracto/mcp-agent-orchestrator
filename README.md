# Multi-Agent Development System

A sophisticated system that coordinates multiple AI coding assistants (Cursor and Claude Code) acting as specialized developers. Uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool integration and custom coordination layers for agent communication and workflow orchestration.

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a multi-agent development team where AI coding assistants collaborate like human developers. Each agent specializes in different roles (BA/PM, Backend Dev, Frontend Dev, Testers, DevOps) and communicates through MCP servers.

### Key Features

- **Platform-Agnostic Architecture**: Works with any MCP-compatible AI coding assistant
- **Distributed Coordination**: Event-driven messaging between agents
- **Specialized Roles**: Each agent has specific capabilities and responsibilities
- **Fault Tolerance**: Built-in circuit breakers and rollback mechanisms
- **Observable**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracing

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **MCP Servers** - Protocol implementation for agent coordination
   - Task Coordinator
   - Message Queue
   - Shared Workspace
   - Documentation Hub

2. **Agent Framework** - Base classes and utilities for AI agents
   - Base Agent Class
   - MCP Client
   - State Manager
   - Communication Layer

3. **Specialized Agents**
   - Business Analyst/PM (Orchestrator)
   - Backend Developer
   - Frontend Developer
   - Various Testing Agents
   - DevOps Agent

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **MCP Servers**: Node.js/Python
- **Agent Framework**: Python with async/await
- **Message Queue**: Redis/RabbitMQ
- **State Management**: Event sourcing
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+ LTS
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-dev-system.git
cd multi-agent-dev-system
```

2. Set up Python environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

npm install
```

4. Start Docker services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🧪 Development

### Test-Driven Development

This project follows strict TDD practices:
- Write tests first (Red)
- Implement minimum code (Green)
- Refactor (Refactor)
- Minimum 85% coverage required

### Running Tests

```bash
# Python tests
pytest --cov=agent-framework --cov-report=html

# Node.js tests
npm test

# All tests
make test-all
```

### Code Quality

- Python: Black formatter, PEP 8 compliance
- JavaScript: ESLint with Prettier
- Pre-commit hooks for consistency
