### Sprint Timeline
- **Day 1-2:** US-001 (Basic MCP Server Template)
- **Day 2-3:** US-004 (Platform Documentation) - Can be done in parallel
- **Day 3-4:** US-002 (Multi-Instance Demo)
- **Day 4-5:** US-003 (Message Queue)

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code is written following TDD approach
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 85% coverage minimum
- [ ] Code passes all linting checks
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Code is reviewed and merged to develop
- [ ] Feature is demonstrated to work

### Sprint Risks
1. **MCP Protocol Learning Curve** - Mitigation: Study existing MCP servers
2. **Platform Limitations** - Mitigation: Early testing and documentation
3. **Integration Complexity** - Mitigation: Start simple, iterate

### Daily Standup Questions
1. What did you complete yesterday?
2. What will you work on today?
3. Are there any blockers?

## Notes
- Each sprint should have a demo at the end
- Retrospective after each sprint to improve process
- Adjust velocity based on actual completion rate
